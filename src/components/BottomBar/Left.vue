             It steps aside while the player is silent, and that is a decision
             about which of the two matters more in that moment. Five controls
             do not fit a 360px phone: cover 48 + unmute 44 + transport 164 +
             devices 44 is 300 of the 328 available, which left the title 12px
             and its text ran straight under the unmute box. Silence means
             nothing is audible anywhere, so "get the sound back" outranks "play
             this in sync with another device" — and Devices stays reachable on
