    as the charts screen. What is NOT reused is `Stats.vue` around them: it
    splits its list into "all but the last" and "the last", which is how the
    charts screen sets the top track apart. Four equal numbers have nothing to
    set apart, and the split showed up as a gap in the middle of the row. -->

 * and rebuilt on every search and every clearing of the field, so an uncached
 * call would run a whole-history aggregation per pause in typing — but three
