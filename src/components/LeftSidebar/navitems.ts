// glyph individually — the icons came from three different sets and filled
// their viewBox by different amounts. They are one set now, so there is

  // moved. The value is a class suffix (`tint-teal` -> `.nav-item.tint-teal`).
  //
  // ⚠️ THE ORDER IS PART OF THE VALUE. Toned to pastel, green and teal sit
  // close enough that Home above Folders read as one colour twice — so the
  // sequence alternates warm and cool and keeps the two red-ish fills (pink,
  // coral) apart:
  //
  //   green · lavender · coral  —  separator —  teal · pink · yellow
  //
  // Moving an entry means checking its new neighbours, not just its own fill.
