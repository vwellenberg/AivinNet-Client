// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The settings modal has ONE height for every pane.
//
// Its panes differ a lot in length — Profile is a handful of fields, Appearance
// is nine setting plates — and the modal is centred, so a box sized by its
// content moved all four edges on every tab switch. Measured at 1440x900 before
// the fix: Appearance at y=32 h=836, every other pane at y=113 h=674, i.e. the
// close button and the whole nav list jumped 81px between two clicks. The user
// reported it as the window jumping back and forth.
//
// Two declarations carry the fix, in two different files:
//   - `.m-content.settings` states the height, from the token, capped by the
//     window (a pane scrolls inside the frame — it already could)
//   - `.settingsmodal` takes `flex: 1`, or it would keep sizing itself to its
//     content inside a box that now has a height of its own, leaving the
//     sidebar's frame hanging in mid-air
//
// That the frame actually stands still was verified in a browser: identical
// rects across all seven tabs at 1440x900 and 1280x720, and across list/detail
// at 390 and 360 wide.
