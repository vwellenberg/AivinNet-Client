// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The favourited state is a COLOUR, and every role has to let it through.
//
// `HeartSvg.vue` states the state once — `.heart-button.is-fav { color: teal }`
// — and then hands each footprint its anatomy through a role. Every one of
// those role blocks includes a `btn-*` mixin, and every one of those mixins
// sets `color`. They match at the SAME specificity as the state rule (0,2,0)
// and sit LATER in the file, so each new role silently takes the colour away
// again unless it re-asserts it.
//
// That is not hypothetical. `role-action` has carried the re-assert since #90.
// `role-bar` arrived with #387 without it, and the marker in the player bar
// measured `fill: rgb(23,23,26)` on the deployed app where the same marker in a
// track row measures `rgb(47,191,163)`. Nobody saw it for a release, because
// the glyph of the day was a disc with a fixed ink edge and an ink tick: ink on
// ink reads as a dark blob, not as a wrong colour.
//
// So this counts the roles instead of naming them — a fourth role added
// tomorrow fails here until it decides about the state colour.
