// A section caption on the page ground is a STICKER (`mem-sticker`), never bare
// text.
//
// The ground is grid paper *plus* the memphis doodles, and the doodle tile is
// 3840x1600 — so "a shape happens to sit behind this word" is the normal case,
// not the exception. Every caption in the app had already answered that: the
// card-row captions, "Top Tracks", "Browse Library", "Up Next" / "Queue", the
// chart groups, the page titles, and the recent-searches head. The two on the
// search page's Top tab ("Top Result", "Tracks") never were — they carried a
// theme-aware `color` and nothing else, which does nothing about a saturated
// shape running behind them. Reported by the user off a screenshot of that tab.
//
// The point of the census is the SHAPE of that miss: neither caption looked
// wrong in its own file. It only shows next to the sticker one screen over. So
// this test COLLECTS the hosts (every component that renders an <h2>/<h3>)
// rather than listing the known ones, and makes each of them answer: sticker,
// or an entry below saying which surface it sits on instead. A new page-level
// caption fails here until someone decides which it is.
//
// Scope note: headings are the enumerable half. Captions that are not heading
// elements — CardScroller's `.rtitle` (<b>), `SeeAll` — carry `mem-sticker`
// through their own rules and are covered by nothing here; a heading element is
// what a new section caption is written as.

//
// The same captions that were bare text once carried a left inset for the
// reason bare text needs one: keeping the word off the page edge. A sticker
// carries that gap inside itself (the chip's padding), so the leftover margin
// only moves the plate out of the line its own rows keep — measured on the
// deployed app, "Up Next"/"Queue" stood 16px (8px in the narrow column) right
// of the tracks they label, while every caption on Home sits flush at 303.
//
// Two halves, because the leftover was written both ways and only one of them
// moves the plate:
//
//   MARGIN-left  — moves the chip off the line. Must be zero.
//   PADDING-left — grows the chip inwards, so the plate stays put and the TEXT
//                  drifts. It is the chip's own space and `mem-sticker` sets
//                  both sides at once; a rule that touches one side alone makes
//                  it lopsided (Artist/Favorites "Top Tracks": 16px left
//                  against 8px right). So padding is checked for SYMMETRY, not
//                  for zero — a caption is free to be a bigger chip.
//
// The vertical margins are the air between sections and no business of this.
//
// ⚠️ Known blind spot, stated rather than left to be discovered: a FOREIGN file
// reaching a caption through an ELEMENT selector (`.fav-tracks h3 { … }`) is not
// covered. Class selectors are, compound forms included — a caption's class is
// app-wide, so those are enumerable — but `h3` app-wide would flag every card
// title in the app. The two foreign insets found here were removed and the rule
// in styling.md says where a caption's rules belong; this census cannot prove
// the next one.
