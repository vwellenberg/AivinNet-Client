// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A drag carries an index, and an index only means something inside the list it
// came from. Two halves have to hold, and each was broken on its own:
//
//   1. A row that never opted into dragging must not start one. `<img>` is
//      natively draggable, so grabbing the cover fired `dragstart` on the row —
//      `draggable="false"` on the row does NOT stop that. Every search result
//      and album track was draggable through its cover.
//   2. A drop target must refuse a foreign source. `PlaylistView` took the
//      `source` argument and named it `_source`: received, ignored. A cover
//      dragged out of the search onto a playlist row reordered the playlist by
//      the search result's position.
//
// Together they were a path to silent data loss in a playlist — the class of
// bug this repo has already paid for twice (.claude/rules/playlist-writes.md).
//
// This is a source census rather than a behaviour test because the failure is
// an ABSENCE: nothing throws, nothing logs, the playlist just ends up in an
// order nobody asked for.
