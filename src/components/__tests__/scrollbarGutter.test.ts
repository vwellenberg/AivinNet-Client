// The cover veil has to survive the scrollbar.
//
// The content scrollers reserve the bar's width as a gutter on both edges
// (`scrollbar-gutter: stable both-edges`). The right gutter is not empty space
// — it holds the real scrollbar widget, and Chrome paints that in a layer of
// its own, outside the scrollport where scrolled CONTENT is clipped. A veil
// built as a CHILD of the scroller therefore stops $scrollbar-w short of the
// right content edge, and the transparent track shows bare grid paper through
// the gap, the full height of the header band. That was #483's
// `.page-gradient-decor`, and no left/right value could have fixed it: those
// pixels belong to the scrollbar, not to the content.
//
// A BACKGROUND of the scroll container does reach them — it is painted under
// the scrollbar and shows through the transparent track — and
// `background-attachment: local` keeps it scrolling away with the header, which
// was the reason the veil sat inside the scroller in the first place.
//
// ⚠️ Why this is a census and not a screenshot test: headless Chromium paints
// NO scrollbar at all. Even a fully opaque red track leaves the screenshot
// unchanged, so the strip measures clean headless whether it is broken or not
// — which is how #483 was signed off while the gap was still there on the
// user's screen. The real-browser check is the one that counts.
