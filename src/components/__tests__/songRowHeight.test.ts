// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A fixed-size scroller pitches its rows at exactly `item-size`. It does not
// measure, and nothing complains when the number is wrong: the item wrapper is
// `overflow: visible` (app-grid.scss), so a row taller than the pitch simply
// draws over the one above it. What disappears under that overlap is the
// BOTTOM of the previous row — which is where the inlay's perforation lives.
//
// Three lists shipped a hand-written `64` against a 72px row. Measured on the
// running app, every separator on the artist "show all tracks" page and the
// search Tracks tab came out rgb(226,224,220) instead of the ink rgb(23,23,26)
// the album view (a measuring DynamicScroller) painted: 8% of the dashes
// showing through the next row's 92%-opaque veil plate. No test, no lint and no
// screenshot of a single file could say so — the number was right next to a
// scroller that behaved, and the row height lived in a stylesheet.
//
// So both halves are pinned here: the constant against the SCSS token, and
// every fixed-size track scroller against the constant.
