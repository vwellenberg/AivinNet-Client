// One leading edge per page.
//
// A section caption, the cards or rows under it and the page head all start on
// the SAME line (styling.md, "Der Sticker fluchtet links"). Drift off it is
// invisible in isolation — each element looks fine in its own file and its own
// screenshot — and only shows next to the neighbour that does it right. Every
// instance so far was reported from a user screenshot, never by a test:
//
//   #528  the sort banner's chip row      12px in (chips 315, cards 303)
//   #550  the genre banner                12px in, and the stat tiles under it
//         (16px on /stats, which reads the component's own padding while the
//         two detail pages override it)
//   here  the chart group's three non-row children: the scrobble caption
//         (322.2/1373.8), the pager (319/1377) and the empty-state plate,
//         against chart rows spanning 303/1393
//
// `sectionCaptionSticker` polices this for HEADINGS. These are the rows that
// are not headings and therefore answer to nobody — until here.
//
// The hosts are SWEPT, not listed: an inset on these rows does not have to live
// in the row's own file, and twice it did not (two page stylesheets carried the
// stat tiles' one). A third page adding one is exactly how the last of these
// survived a round of fixes.
//
// Scope note: LEFT only. The right edge is a real half of the rule for a
// `space-between` row — the chart caption's trend sticker has to end where the
// rows end — but several of these rows keep a deliberate `padding-right` as
// shadow reserve for horizontal scrolling (`.statshead`, the genre banner's
// scroller). Sweeping the right side would have to carry that exception list;
// the left side carries none.
//
// ⚠️ A source-scanning test goes quietly green when its parser breaks (see
// .claude/rules/testing.md), so every expectation below is paired with a guard
// over its own input.

 * no edge of its own, so padding is the thing that pushes its children off the
 * page's line — that is precisely what the genre banner and the stat rows did.
 * A PLATE's padding sits inside its own frame: the plate's edge is what lines
 * up, and taking the padding away would press the text against the border. The
 * empty-state plate on the charts screen is the second kind, and reading its
 * `padding: 1rem` as an inset was this census's first false positive.
 *
 * Either way the MARGIN always counts — that moves the box itself.
