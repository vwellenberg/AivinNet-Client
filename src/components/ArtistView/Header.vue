             positioned element that had to be kept in sync with the head's own
             height), the dark scrim for the small-phone layout, and the photo

                     answers 200 even for an artist with no photo: it falls back
                     to the backend's own assets/artist.webp, so `@error` does
                     NOT fire in the common no-photo case. This covers the two
                     cases the backend can't: an empty `image` field, and a
