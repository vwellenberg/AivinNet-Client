// The favourite toggle takes a ROLE, like every other button in the app (#90).
//
// It used to hand-write its own anatomy — `height: 2.25rem` plus
// `aspect-ratio: 1.5` for the box, a global `.circular` utility class for the
// radius — and that cost twice over. The height was silently load-bearing (a
// ratio needs one dimension to resolve, and the button base stopped supplying
// one at #244; this button measured 54x36 -> 28x28 the day it did). And the
// radius came from a utility class sitting at the SAME specificity as this
// rule, so which of the two won was decided by bundle order rather than by
// anyone's intention.
//
// Stating them through the role fixed the ordering luck — but it stated the
// WRONG box, and nothing said so, because every call site was already busy
// correcting it: 54x36 with a 1.75rem glyph is a header-sized control, and the
// three places that take the bare variant are a track row, a queue row and a
// player bar. Measured, the component's declared box rendered in exactly zero
// of them.
//
// So the bare variant is the compact scale now — square, `$control-compact`,
// the same footprint the ⋯ button beside it in a track row has had all along
// (2rem, it was just never named). Square also retires the pill radius: a pill
// on a 54-wide box was a shape, on a 32px square it would be a circle, and this
// design rounds its controls at `$candy-radius-sm`.

        // What stood here was `transform: scale(0.75)` on the check, because
        // the old asset was a solid r=14 disc in a 28 box: 100% of its viewBox
