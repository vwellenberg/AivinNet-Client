// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Census: every queue mutation has to reach the device-sync seam.
//
// The rule itself is old ("in group mode EVERY queue action goes through
// `ds.intercept()`", CLAUDE.md + .claude/rules/device-sync.md). What was missing
// is a check that counts the mutations instead of naming them: `queue.groupmode`
// asserts a FIXED list of actions, so a new mutation that never learned about
// the seam stays green there. That is exactly how `insertAfterCurrent` — the
// "Play next" of five context menus — kept splicing the local list unnoticed
// while the server's queue_id stayed put: nothing re-mirrored, and the mirrored
// currentindex pointed at the wrong track on every other device (#434).
//
// So this test enumerates the mutations from the SOURCE and demands that each
// one either carries the seam itself or delegates to a sister action that does.
// A source-scanning test goes silently green when its parser breaks, so the
// first describe() below guards its own inputs (.claude/rules/testing.md).
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Read off disk, not through `import.meta.glob`: the runner's cwd is the
// project root, and the two more principled anchors do not work here —
// `import.meta.url` is left in a shape `fileURLToPath()` rejects, and
// `process.cwd()` trips `no-undef` (test files get no node env from eslint).
