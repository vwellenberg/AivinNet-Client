/**
 * The caption on the Now-Playing source plate.
 *
 * It used to be `tracklist.from.type` printed straight out of the enum, and the
 * plate's own `text-transform: uppercase` then made two of the eight sources
 * say the same thing twice — "SEARCH" over `Search for: "…"`, "FAVORITE" over
 * "Favorite tracks" — while `playlistFolder` came out as "PLAYLISTFOLDER".
 *
 * On the search source that cost more than a repeated word: a caption, a
 * `Search for:` phrase and the magnifier glyph are between them the anatomy of
 * the app's search FIELD, and on the phone this plate is the topmost element of
 * the Now-Playing screen with no top bar next to it to compare against. It was
 * reported as "why is there a search at the top of the song".
 *
 * These tests pin the two halves that carry that: every source names its kind,
 * and no source's caption is contained in its own name.
