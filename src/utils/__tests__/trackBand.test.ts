// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The colour guide band on the leading edge of a track row alternates two
// accents, and the cycle is computed in JS rather than written as `:nth-child`.
//
// That is not a style preference. Track lists render through
// vue-virtual-scroller, which RECYCLES its row elements: DOM position inside
// the scroller follows the scroll offset, not the list, so an nth-child rule
// repaints on every tick and hands the same track a different colour each time.
// A test rather than a comment because the nth-child version is the obvious one
// to reach for, looks right in a static screenshot, and only misbehaves while
// scrolling.
//
// The second half of the pairing is in SCSS: `mem-band-cycle` emits one
// `band-N` rule per entry in `$mem-band-colours`. A class with no matching rule
// leaves that row with no band at all — silently, since `--band` just falls
// back — so the two counts are checked against each other here.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// `.scss` has to come through `fs`: a raw glob returns an EMPTY string for
// stylesheets, which would make this test silently green
// (.claude/rules/testing.md).
