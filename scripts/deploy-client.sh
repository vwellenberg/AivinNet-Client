# Post-deploy gates. Both live HERE, not in Vitest, because jsdom has no layout
# engine — and both answer a bug class that reached the user before it reached
# a test:
#
#   overflow-check  no phone width may force a wider layout viewport (#433, and
#                   the same bar again at 360px because only 390 was measured)
#   edge-audit      every section caption starts on the same left edge as the
#                   block it labels (#526, #528 — both reported from user
#                   screenshots; padding from a mixin and Sass arithmetic are
#                   invisible to the source censuses and obvious to a browser)
#
# A FAIL exits non-zero so it cannot be missed, and BOTH run before that exit:
# fixing one drift only to be told about the next on the following deploy is
# how a gate becomes something people route around. The SKIP paths stay loud on
# purpose — a gate that silently evaporates is how this class of bug shipped.
