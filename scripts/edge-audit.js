// Every caption on a page, measured against the block it labels.
//
// The design has one rule about leading edges: a section caption, the cards or
// rows under it, and the page head all start on the SAME line (styling.md, "Der
// Sticker fluchtet links"). Drift off that line is invisible in isolation —
// each element looks fine in its own file and its own screenshot — and only
// shows next to a page that does it right. It was reported twice from user
// screenshots (#526 "Up Next"/"Queue" 16px out, #528 six page titles 12px out)
// before anything measured it.
//
// So this measures it. For every sticker caption on a page it finds the first
// following block wide enough to BE the section (>=40% of the content width:
// the list, the grid, the plate) and reports any difference between the two
// left edges. It also reports a chip padded unevenly, which is the same
// leftover in the other box (a caption's chip grows inwards instead of moving).
//
// Env: TOKEN (required, JWT cookie value) · BASE (default http://localhost:1970)
//      WIDTH (default 1440) · ROUTES (default: the list pages; pass detail
//      routes like /albums/<hash> to include them) · MIN_COMPARED (default 8,
//      the floor under which a run counts as broken rather than clean)
// Exit: 0 clean · 1 drift found · 2 harness error (nothing meaningful measured)
//
// Playwright is resolved via NODE_PATH, same as scripts/overflow-check.js.
//
// ⚠️ This is the check the source censuses cannot be: padding that arrives
// through a mixin, a selector built by interpolation and Sass arithmetic are
// all invisible to a source scan, and all perfectly visible here.
