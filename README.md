### Dark theme

The whole palette flips through the moon toggle in the top bar. With **Auto dark mode** on, it also
switches itself: dark from 20:00, light from 08:00, always in Berlin time so every device agrees.

- **Playlist power tools** — drag-and-drop track reordering, pin playlists to the sidebar, and play/pin/delete from a right-click menu.
- **MusicBrainz cover fetching** — grab a missing album cover with one click, or batch-fetch every missing cover from Settings with live progress.
- **Synced lyrics** — timestamped lines with a per-line progress bar; click a line to seek there.

- **Pinia** (state management)
- **SCSS** (styling)
- **Vite** (build tool)
- **Vitest** (unit tests)

---

## Local Development

Requires Node 18+ and Yarn.

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the development server
yarn dev

# Lint (auto-fix) / lint check only (CI)
yarn lint
yarn lint:check

# Run tests
yarn test
```

Tests live in `src/**/__tests__/` as `*.test.ts`.

---

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```

The production output is placed in the `dist/` folder.

---

## Deploy

The client is a static bundle. Build it, put `dist/` where the AivinNet backend looks for its
client, and restart the backend:

```bash
yarn build
rm -rf ~/.config/aivinnet/client
cp -r dist ~/.config/aivinnet/client
systemctl restart aivinnet
```

> **Note:** On Node 18, `yarn install` needs `--ignore-engines`.
